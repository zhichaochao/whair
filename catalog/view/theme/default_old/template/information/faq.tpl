            <h4><i>5</i>I noticed that some of the bundles have a slight lighter hair color than other bundles I have ordered previously. I also discovered a few grey hairs present, is this normal?</h4>
            <div class="quali1 compan_mrp">
            <p>Absolutely. This is perfectly normal. Please understand that 100% pure Virgin hair is untreated hair. It comes from various donors. Some donors are older than others and vice versa. Each donor will have a different hair curl pattern and hair color ranging anywhere from an off black to a natural brown color, and yes, even a few gray strands here or there. At no time will virgin hair bundles ever look the same because all hair is not donated by the same person. What is always consistent is the raw and natural quality of the hair. The gorgeous texture and gentle blend that it has with your own natural hair.</p>
